# Contributing to Tox Testing MCP

We love your input! We want to make contributing to the Tox Testing MCP as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable
2. Update any relevant documentation
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one maintainer

## Any contributions you make will be under the same license as the project

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same license that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.
